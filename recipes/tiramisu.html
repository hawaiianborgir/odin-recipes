        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="base">Tiramisu is an Italian dessert made of ladyfinger pastries (<em>savoiardi</em>) dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of egg yolks, sugar, and mascarpone, and topped with cocoa powder. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts. Its origin is disputed between the Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The name comes from the Italian <em>tirami su</em> (lit. 'pick me up' or 'cheer me up').</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="base">
            <li>Ladyfingers</li>
            <li>Mascarpone</li>
            <li>Coffee</li>
            <li>Heavy whipped cream</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="base">
            <li><strong>Mix creamy filling.</strong> Beat the mascarpone, cream, sugar, and vanilla together until stiff peaks.</li>
            <li><strong>Dip lady fingers. Add the espresso and liqueur</strong> (if using) to a shallow bowl and dip the lady fingers on both sides (don't let them soak–just a quick dip!)</li>
            <li><strong>Layer mascarpone.</strong> Smooth a layer of the mascarpone/whipped cream mixture on top of the lady fingers.</li>
            <li><strong>Repeat.</strong> Add another layer of lady fingers (dipped in coffee and liqueur) and another layer of cheese mixture. Dust with cocoa powder.</li>
        </ol>
